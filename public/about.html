<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Darrell, I grew up in Austin Texas and I've been coding since middle school.
  I started off coding in a program named scratch, within the program i completed small puzzles
  and learned alot about the connectivity of codes. After middle my interest in 
  coding grew. I began learning more coding languges like python, in attempt
  at becoming a cyberscurity professional. After about a year I discovered that my passion in code lies
  within the ability to create new things, after being introduced to web development i fell in love.
  Now i'm a self taught web developer.
